# Exifly

A small python executable that will allow the user to pass in a picture file or files, read the EXIF data, then rename the file in a manner that allows for easy sorting and quick user recognition.

# Depends on:

* Python 2.7
* Python `Pillow` (`PIL` fork) library
* Python `subprocess` module
* `exiftool` command-line application
