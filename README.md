# Exifly

A small python executable that will allow the user to pass in a picture file or files, read the EXIF data, then rename the file in a manner that allows for easy sorting using a file explorer.

# Everything I've tried depends (right now) on:

* Python 2.7
* Python Pillow (PIL fork) library
* Python piexif library
* exiftool command-line application
